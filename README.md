# ClusterProteinDesign

This is a personal repository for running protein design scripts on Slurm. The scripts are designed to use various tools such as RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, AlphaFold2, and Rosetta.


#### TO DO:
- [ ] make new scaffolds from NTF fold? and make different ones by masking and adding residues to the ends
- [ ] write README
- [ ] set on folder structure
- [ ] write cleaner metric scripts and more of them

### BINDER PIPELINES:
- [ ] Fold_seeking
- [ ] Fold_docking
- [ ] Binder_search
- [ ] Binder_building (experimental)
