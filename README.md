# ClusterProteinDesign

This is a personal repository for running protein design scripts on Slurm. The scripts are designed to use various tools such as RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, AlphaFold2, and Rosetta.


#### TO DO:
- [ ] make new scaffolds from NTF fold? and make different ones by masking and adding residues to the ends
- [ ] write cleaner metric scripts and more of them
- [ ] implement saving all generated pdbs in one file (silent?)

### BINDER PIPELINES:
- [ ] Fold_seeking
- [x] Fold_docking
- [ ] Binder_search
- [ ] Dock_and_search
- [ ] Binder_building (experimental)
